Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. HVEM is mentioned as a marker that is upregulated in fibroblasts upon TGFβ1 stimulation, which could be considered a marker for the initial stage of differentiation towards a myofibroblast phenotype.
2. ICAM1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1) is noted to facilitate the interaction between esophageal fibroblasts and eosinophils after LIGHT stimulation, suggesting its role as a marker in this context.

Given these points, we can create the following tuples based on the document's content:

- ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Fibroblast", "HVEM")
- ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Fibroblast", "ICAM1")

The species is specified as "Human" because the context of the document discusses Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), which is a human disease. The tissue type is "Esophageal tissue" since the study focuses on the esophagus. The cell name is "Fibroblast" as the document talks about the differentiation and behavior of fibroblasts. The markers are "HVEM" and "ICAM1" as they are directly associated with the described cellular functions and conditions.

Based on the provided text, there is no explicit mention of specific cell markers (marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers) that are used to distinguish different cell types. The document discusses various proteins and signaling molecules such as LIGHT, HVEM, LTbR, TGFβ1, and ICAM-1, but these are not specifically described as cell markers for distinguishing cell types.

Therefore, the correct response is:

none

Based on the provided text, there is no explicit mention of specific cell markers (marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers) that are used to distinguish different cell types. The document discusses various proteins and their expression in the context of EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis) but does not clearly define them as markers for specific cell types. Therefore, based on the requirements, the response is:

none

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "CD8+ T cell", "CD8")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "CD4+ T cell", "CD4")
3. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Regulatory T cell", "T7 (implied by regulatory T cell–associated phenotype)")
4. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Effector T-helper type 2 cell", "IL13")
5. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Effector T-helper type 2 cell", "IL5")
6. ("Human", "Esophagus", "T cell", "LIGHT")
7. ("Human", "Esophagus", "CD8+ interferon gamma–expressing cell", "IFNG (implied by interferon gamma–expressing)")

Note: The document does not explicitly name a marker for the regulatory T cell (T7) and the CD8+ interferon gamma–expressing cell (T5) beyond their descriptions, so I've included the implied markers based on the context. If you require only explicitly named markers, those entries should be excluded.

Based on the provided text, there are no specific cell markers (marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers) that are explicitly mentioned to distinguish different cell types. The document primarily discusses the effects of LIGHT and TGFβ1 on gene expression in fibroblasts, but it does not provide clear information about cell markers for different cell types.

Therefore, the response is:
none

none

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "CD90")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "Vimentin")
3. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Myofibroblast", "α-SMA")
4. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Eosinophil", "EPX")
5. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "ICAM-1")
6. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "VCAM-1")

These tuples represent the species (Human), the tissue type (Esophagus), the specific cell names, and their corresponding markers as described in the text.

none

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Inflammatory fibroblast", "ICAM1")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Inflammatory fibroblast", "CD74")
3. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Inflammatory fibroblast", "IL32")
4. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Inflammatory fibroblast", "IL33")
5. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Inflammatory fibroblast", "C3")

14. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Inflammatory fibroblast", "VCAM-1")
15. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Myofibroblast", "a-SMA")

These tuples are derived from the text where specific genes or proteins (markers) are associated with particular cell types in a specified tissue and species.

none

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "T cell", "CD3")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "T cell", "LIGHT")

These are the only clear markers mentioned in the text that fit the criteria of being used to distinguish different cell types or states (e.g., T cells in healthy vs. EoE conditions). Other molecules and genes mentioned (like ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL5, IL13, etc.) are not explicitly described as markers for specific cell types but rather as part of a broader gene expression profile or pathway analysis.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified. The information is extracted and formatted as per the specified requirements:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "α-SMA")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "ICAM-1")
3. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "VCAM-1")
4. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "CD90")
5. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Fibroblast", "Vimentin")

These tuples are based on the markers mentioned in the context of fibroblasts from patients with active EoE (eosinophilic esophagitis).
