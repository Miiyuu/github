Based on the information provided in the document, the following cell markers have been identified for human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells:

1. ("Human", "Retina", "Retinal pigment epithelial cell", "CD140b")
2. ("Human", "Retina", "Retinal pigment epithelial cell", "CD56")
3. ("Human", "Retina", "Retinal pigment epithelial cell", "GD2")
4. ("Human", "Retina", "Retinal pigment epithelial cell", "CD184")

These markers were identified as being useful for evaluating the differentiation efficiency of hPSPC into RPE cells and for enriching RPE cells during and after the differentiation process.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Optic vesicle", "RPE cells", "CD140b") - CD140b (recognizing PDGFRB) is a marker that appears at the optic vesicle stage and remains highly expressed in more mature hPSC-RPE cells.
2. ("Human", "Optic vesicle", "RPE cells", "CD104") - CD104 (recognizing integrin β4 chain) specifically labels more mature and pure hPSC-RPE cells but is not significantly present in early optical vesicle stages.
3. ("Human", "Optic vesicle", "Alternative lineages", "GD2") - GD2 (recognizing Disialoganglioside GD2) labels a large fraction of cells at the optic vesicle stage but is absent at later stages, suggesting it may label alternative lineages.
4. ("Human", "Optic vesicle", "Alternative lineages", "CD184") - CD184 (recognizing C–X–C motif chemokine receptor 4) also labels a large fraction of cells at the optic vesicle stage and is absent at later stages, indicating it might be marking alternative lineages.

The document does not provide specific information about the expression of these markers in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) other than mentioning that CD59, which is not unique to RPE cells, is expressed in both RPE and hESC. Therefore, no tuple is created for CD59 as per the requirement.

3. ("Human", "Retina", "hPSC-RPE cell", "TYR")
4. ("Human", "Retina", "hPSC-RPE cell", "RPE65")
5. ("Human", "Retina", "hPSC-RPE cell", "POU5F1") - Note: This is mentioned as a pluripotency marker with lower expression in hPSC-RPE cells.
6. ("Human", "Retina", "hPSC-RPE cell", "MAP2") - Note: This is mentioned as a neuronal marker with lower expression in hPSC-RPE cells.
7. ("Human", "Retina", "hPSC-RPE cell", "TUBB3") - Note: This is mentioned as a neuronal marker with lower expression in hPSC-RPE cells.

The provided text does not contain specific information about cell markers in the required format, including species, tissue type, and cell name alongside a marker. The document discusses RPE (Retinal Pigment Epithelium) cells and mentions CD140b (PDGFRB) as a marker for these cells during differentiation, but it lacks the detailed context of species and tissue type necessary to form a complete tuple as per the instructions. Therefore, based on the given requirements, the response is "none".
