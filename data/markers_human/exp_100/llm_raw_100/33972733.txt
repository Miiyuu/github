Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Basal cell", "KRT14")
2. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Suprabasal cell", "KRT4")
3. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Basal progenitor cell", "SOX2")
4. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Suprabasal differentiated cell", "KLF4")

These tuples follow the format specified, with the species, tissue type, cell name, and marker identified from the text.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Basal cell", "KLF4")
2. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Suprabasal cell", "KRT4")
3. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Basal cell", "KRT14")
4. ("Mouse", "Oesophagus", "Basal and suprabasal cell", "SOX2")

These tuples are based on the expression patterns of KLF4, KRT4, KRT14, and SOX2 in different cell types within the oesophageal tissue as described in the document.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

- KLF4 is expressed in a subset of basal cells in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and appears to mark a committed, non-proliferative population. The species under study is mouse, and the tissue type is the olfactory epithelium.

- KRT4 and KRT14 are keratins that are differentially expressed in the KLF4+/- basal populations within the same tissue. The expression of KRT4 is particularly enriched in the KLF4+ population, indicating a bias towards differentiation.

Given these details, the tuples for the cell markers would be:

1. ("Mouse", "Olfactory epithelium", "Basal cell", "KLF4")
2. ("Mouse", "Olfactory epithelium", "Basal cell", "KRT4")
3. ("Mouse", "Olfactory epithelium", "Basal cell", "KRT14")

The information provided does not specify any other clear markers, so no additional tuples are generated.

Based on the provided document, I identified the following cell markers:

1. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "KLF4")
2. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "YAP")
3. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Cyr61")
4. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Ctgf")
5. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Thbs1")
6. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Cav1")
7. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Klf2")
8. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Dcn")
9. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Krt4")
10. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Krt13")
11. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Cdnk1a")
12. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Cebpb")

The document does not specify a particular tissue type, so "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field in all tuples. The species being studied is clearly mentioned as Mouse. The cell type of interest is Basal cells, and various markers are associated with this cell type based on their gene expression patterns.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Cd44")
2. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Ly6a")

4. ("null", "oesophagus", "epithelial cell", "Krt8")

13. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Mmp14")
14. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Dcn")
15. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Lad1")
16. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Cfl1")
17. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Dstn")
18. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Dsc3")
19. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Rhob")
20. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Klf4")

23. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Cdkn1a")
24. ("null", "null", "basal cell", "Cebpb")

These tuples are derived from the specific mentions of genes that serve as markers for different cell types and stages within the document. The species and tissue type were not explicitly stated in most cases, so they are marked as "null".

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified. The information is formatted as per the instructions:

1. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Klf4")
2. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Cyr61")
3. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Thbs1")
4. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Nrg1")
5. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Nrg2")

15. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Ajuba")
16. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Ctgf")
17. ("Mouse", "null", "Basal cell", "Dcn")

The document does not specify a particular tissue type for these basal cells, so "Tissue Type" is filled with "null". Each marker listed has differential expression in the context of basal cells and their differentiation or response to mechanical stimuli.

Based on the provided text, the document discusses KLF4 as a marker for basal cells in the oesophagus (OE) of mice. The species, tissue type, and cell name can be inferred from the context. Here is the tuple based on the information:

- Species: Mouse
- Tissue Type: Oesophageal tissue
- Cell Name: Basal cell
- Marker: KLF4

Thus, the tuple is:

```python
("Mouse", "Oesophageal tissue", "Basal cell", "KLF4")
```

No other markers are mentioned in the given text, so no additional tuples are needed.
