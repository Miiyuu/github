none

The provided text does not contain specific information about cell markers that are differentially expressed to distinguish various cell types. The document primarily discusses the effects of a Foxn1 knockout on gene expression and biological processes, but it does not provide clear marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers for distinct cell types.
