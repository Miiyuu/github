Based on the provided document, I have identified the following cell markers. The information is presented in the requested format:

1. ("null", "null", "GC B cells", "CXCL17")
2. ("null", "null", "GC B cells", "AGR2")
3. ("null", "null", "GC B cells", "MUC20")

The document does not provide specific details about the species or the tissue type for these markers, hence "null" is used for those fields. Additionally, the markers CXCL17, AGR2, and MUC20 are associated with GC B cells within the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) survival.

Based on the information provided in the document, here are the cell markers identified and formatted as requested:

1. ("null", "null", "Epithelial cell", "EPCAM")
2. ("null", "null", "Epithelial cell", "SFN")
3. ("null", "null", "Epithelial cell", "KRT5")

34. ("null", "null", "Myeloid cell", "CLEC4C")
35. ("null", "null", "Myeloid cell", "TPSAB1")

The document did not specify the species or tissue type, hence these fields are filled with "null".

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. CD45 - used to identify immune cells (including tDCs and T cells).
2. CCR7 - a marker for tDCs in the context of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells.
3. CD274 (PD-L1) - another marker for tDCs, particularly in the context of this study.
4. CD8 - a well-known marker for cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Given these details, the tuples based on the information available in the document are as follows:

- ("Human", "ESCC tumor", "tumor-infiltrating tDCs", "CD45")
- ("Human", "ESCC tumor", "tumor-infiltrating tDCs", "CCR7")
- ("Human", "ESCC tumor", "tumor-infiltrating tDCs", "CD274")
- ("Human", "Peripheral blood", "CD8+ T cells", "CD8")

Therefore, the final list is:

```python
[
    ("Human", "ESCC tumor", "tumor-infiltrating tDCs", "CD45"),
    ("Human", "ESCC tumor", "tumor-infiltrating tDCs", "CCR7"),
    ("Human", "ESCC tumor", "tumor-infiltrating tDCs", "CD274"),
    ("Human", "Peripheral blood", "CD8+ T cells", "CD8")
]
```

The provided text does not contain specific information about cell markers used to distinguish different cell types. The document discusses mutational signatures and immunohistochemical staining of certain proteins (AGR2, CXCL17, MUC20) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumors, but it does not specify these as markers for particular cell types. Therefore, no valid tuples can be formed based on the given requirements.
