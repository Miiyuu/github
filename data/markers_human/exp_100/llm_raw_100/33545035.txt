Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Uterus", "Mast cell", "TNF")
2. ("Human", "Uterus", "Mast cell", "VEGFA")

The document discusses the expression of TNF and VEGFA in mast cells across different cancer types, specifically mentioning their roles in uterus tissue. Since the species is not explicitly stated but the context refers to human studies (e.g., TCGA project, which typically involves human samples), "Human" is used for the species. The tissue type is inferred as "Uterus" based on the discussion about the adjacent normal uterus and UCEC (which stands for Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma).

Based on the provided text, I have identified the following cell markers. The information is organized into tuples as requested:

1. ("Human", "null", "Mast cell", "KIT")
2. ("Human", "null", "Mast cell", "TPSAB1")
3. ("Human", "null", "Mast cell", "CPA3")
4. ("Human", "null", "Mast cell", "TPSB2")
5. ("Human", "null", "Macrophage", "SPP1")
6. ("Human", "null", "Macrophage", "FN1")
7. ("Human", "null", "Macrophage", "VCAN")
8. ("Human", "Lung cancer", "Macrophage", "PPARG")
9. ("Human", "Lung cancer", "Macrophage", "MARCO")
10. ("Human", "Lung cancer", "Macrophage", "MRC1")
11. ("Human", "Lung cancer", "Macrophage", "MSR1")
12. ("Human", "null", "Mast cell", "TNF")
13. ("Human", "null", "Mast cell", "VEGFA")

The document does not specify the species for some of the entries, but it can be inferred from the context that these are human studies. Tissue types and other details were filled in with "null" where they were not explicitly stated.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. LAMP3 is a marker for LAMP3+ cDCs (conventional dendritic cells). However, the species and tissue type are not explicitly mentioned in the text. Given the context, it is likely that this refers to human samples across various cancer types, but since the exact species and tissue type are not specified, we will use "null" for those fields.
2. CXCL9 and IDO1 are differentially expressed in the C06_cDC2_CXCL9 sub-cluster of cDC2s. The species and tissue type are not specified, so "null" will be used for these fields as well.
3. SPP1 and C1QC are distinct expression patterns in macrophage subsets, specifically in C1QC+ and SPP1+ macrophages. Again, the species and tissue type are not specified, so "null" will be used.

The tuples based on the information extracted are:

- ("null", "null", "LAMP3+ cDCs", "LAMP3")
- ("null", "null", "C06_cDC2_CXCL9", "CXCL9")
- ("null", "null", "C06_cDC2_CXCL9", "IDO1")
- ("null", "null", "C1QC+ macrophage", "C1QC")
- ("null", "null", "SPP1+ macrophage", "SPP1")

Thus, the final list of tuples is:

```python
[
    ("null", "null", "LAMP3+ cDCs", "LAMP3"),
    ("null", "null", "C06_cDC2_CXCL9", "CXCL9"),
    ("null", "null", "C06_cDC2_CXCL9", "IDO1"),
    ("null", "null", "C1QC+ macrophage", "C1QC"),
    ("null", "null", "SPP1+ macrophage", "SPP1")
]
```

none
