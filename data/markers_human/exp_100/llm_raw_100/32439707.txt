Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "Eye", "TM1 and TM2 cells (with preference for JCT (TM1 cells))", "RSPO2")
2. ("Human", "Eye", "Schlemm's canal (SC) and neighboring endothelial-lined vessels", "LYVE1")

The document mentions RSPO2 as a marker that labels both TM1 and TM2 cells with a preference for JCT (TM1 cells). It also indicates that LYVE1 is a marker that stains some cells in the TM, particularly around the SC lumen and lymphatic vessels. Other mentioned markers like endothelial nitric oxide synthase, VEGF receptor-3, trefoil factor-3, TMEM88, and PLP were not specific or negative, so they are not included.
