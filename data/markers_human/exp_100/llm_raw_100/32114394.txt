Based on the provided document, the following cell marker information can be extracted:

- The species being studied is implicitly human, as the research involves tuberculosis, a disease that affects humans.
- The tissue type is not explicitly mentioned but given the context of blood and PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), we can infer it's related to blood.
- A specific NK (Natural Killer) cell subset is identified with markers "CD3-", "CD7+", and "GZMB+".

Thus, the relevant tuple based on the requirements and the content of the document is:

```python
("Human", "Blood", "NK cell", "CD3-CD7+GZMB+")
```

The other fields are filled as per the guidelines, and since the marker field is not empty, this tuple is valid.

none

The provided text does not contain specific information about cell markers, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers that are used to distinguish different cell types. The document primarily discusses the study design, patient cohorts, and a general finding related to NK cell subsets (CD3-CD7+GZMB+) in the context of TB, LTBI, and healthy controls. However, it does not provide detailed marker information as required by the format specified.

These tuples include the species, tissue type (if specified, otherwise "null"), cell name, and marker as per the given requirements.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "null", "Intermediate monocyte", "CD14+CD16+")
2. ("Human", "null", "M6 monocyte", "CD14+CD16+")

The species is inferred as "Human" since the document discusses human diseases and conditions (e.g., TB, LTBI). The tissue type is not explicitly mentioned for these cells, so it's marked as "null".

These tuples are based on the information provided in the text regarding the NK cell subsets T2 and T7, and their associated markers. The tissue type is not specified in the text, so it is filled with "null".

These tuples are constructed based on the information given in the text, where specific markers are associated with different cell types. The "Tissue Type" is marked as "null" because the document does not specify a particular tissue type for these markers.

Based on the provided text, I have identified the following cell markers. The information is formatted as requested:

1. ("Human", "null", "T2 (subset of T cells)", "GZMB")
2. ("Human", "null", "T2 (subset of T cells)", "SPON2")
