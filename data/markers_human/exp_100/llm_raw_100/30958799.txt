Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Treg (T regulatory) cell", "FOXP3")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Effector Th2 cell", "GATA3")
3. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Effector Th2 cell", "HPGDS")

5. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Effector Th2 cell", "IL-17RB")
6. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Effector Th2 cell", "FFAR3")

These tuples are derived from the specific mentions of marker genes and proteins that distinguish different T cell subtypes within the context of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "null", "T lymphocyte", "IL-5")
2. ("Human", "null", "T lymphocyte", "IL-17RB")
3. ("Human", "null", "CD4+ T cell", "CD25/IL-2Rα")
4. ("Human", "null", "CD8+ T cell", "CD25/IL-2Rα")

The document does not specify a particular tissue type, hence "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field. The species discussed in the text is human, and the markers are associated with T lymphocytes, specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

none

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified and formatted as requested:

1. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "T lymphocyte", "ITGAE (CD103)")
2. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "CD3+ T cell", "CXCR4")
3. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "CD3+ T cell", "CCR5")

These tuples are derived directly from the information in the text, where specific markers were mentioned in relation to certain cell types within the context of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) studies.

Based on the provided document, there is no explicit mention of specific cell markers (marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers) that are used to distinguish different cell types. The document discusses T cell clusters and their presence in EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis) but does not list specific markers for these cell types.

Therefore, the correct response based on the given text is:

21. ("Human", "null", "T8 (effector Th2)", "IL1RL1 (ST2L)")

The tissue type is not explicitly mentioned in the text, hence it is marked as "null". The species is assumed to be "Human" based on the context of the study, which appears to focus on human cells and diseases such as EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis).

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("null", "null", "T8", "GATA3")
2. ("null", "null", "T7", "FOXP3")
3. ("null", "null", "T8", "PPARG")
4. ("null", "null", "T8", "AHR")
5. ("null", "null", "T8", "NR3C1")
6. ("null", "null", "T8", "NFKBIZ")
7. ("null", "null", "T8", "NFATC3")
8. ("null", "null", "T8", "NFAT5")
9. ("null", "null", "T8", "JUN")

The species and tissue type are not specified in the text, so they are filled with "null". The markers are clearly associated with specific T cell clusters (T7 and T8).

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL-4")
2. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL-5")
3. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL-13")
4. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "T lymphocyte", "IFNG")

These cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) are specifically mentioned as being produced by Th2 cells within the EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis) tissue, and IFNG is noted to be expressed by T lymphocytes across all disease states. The species in this case is human, and the tissue type is specified as EoE tissue.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. The cytokine **IFNG (interferon-γ)** is associated with T helper cells, particularly in the context of human esophageal tissue during active EoE (eosinophilic esophagitis). This cytokine is a marker for Th1 cells.
2. The cytokines **IL4, IL5, and IL13** are associated with Th2 cells, which are also part of the CD3+ T cell population in the same tissue.

Given the information, we can create the following tuples:

- ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th1 cell", "IFNG")
- ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL4")
- ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL5")
- ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL13")

Thus, the final list of tuples is:

```python
[
    ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th1 cell", "IFNG"),
    ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL4"),
    ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL5"),
    ("Human", "Esophageal tissue", "Th2 cell", "IL13")
]
```

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "null", "CD4+ T cell", "IL-2")
2. ("Human", "null", "CD4+ T cell", "TNF-α")
3. ("Human", "null", "CD4+ T cell", "IFN-γ")
4. ("Human", "null", "CD8+ T cell", "IFN-γ")
5. ("Human", "null", "CD8+ T cell", "TNF-α")
6. ("Human", "null", "T7 (T cell cluster)", "IL10")

The document does not specify a particular tissue type for these cells, hence "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field. The species discussed in the context appears to be human, as it mentions patient data and conditions like EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis) which are typically studied in humans.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified and formatted as requested:

1. ("Human", "null", "Treg (T7)", "FOXP3")
2. ("Human", "null", "T7 (Treg)", "IL10")
3. ("Human", "null", "T7 (Treg)", "TGFB1")
4. ("Human", "null", "CD4+ T cells", "IL10")
5. ("Human", "null", "CD8+ T cells", "IL10")
6. ("Human", "null", "T7 (Treg)", "IL2RA/CD25")
7. ("Human", "null", "T8", "IL2RA/CD25")
8. ("Human", "null", "CD8+ T1–T6", "TGFB1")
9. ("Human", "null", "T7", "TGFB1")
10. ("Human", "null", "T1–T3", "IL17A")
11. ("Human", "null", "T7", "IL17A")

The document does not specify a particular tissue type, so "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field where it is not mentioned. The species is inferred to be "Human" based on the context of the research article.

The provided text does not contain specific information about cell markers (marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers) that are used to distinguish different cell types with the required format. The text discusses TCR repertoires, gene correlations, and pathways, but it does not provide the necessary details to form the tuples as specified.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "T cells (IL5 producers)", "IL5")
2. ("Human", "EoE tissue", "T cells (FFAR3+)", "FFAR3")
3. ("Human", "Blood", "CD4+ T cells", "FFAR3")
4. ("Mouse", "Lung", "CD4+ lymphocytes", "IL-4")

The identification is based on the differential expression of these markers in specific cell types and conditions as described in the text. For instance, IL5 is used to identify a subset of T cells, while FFAR3 is associated with both T cells that produce IL5 and those that do not, but are present in EoE conditions. Additionally, FFAR3 is upregulated in human blood CD4+ T cells under certain conditions, and IL-4 is used to identify CD4+ lymphocytes in a mouse model.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Human", "null", "Treg-like cells", "CD4+ FOXP3+ IL-10+ CTLA4+ IL-2A(CD25)+ IL-1R1/R2+")
2. ("Human", "null", "Th2 cells", "CD4+ GATA3+ IL-4+ IL-5+ IL-13+ HPGDS+ CRTH2+ IL-17RB+ CD40LG (CD154)+ NFAT1+ NFκ-B1+ AHR+ NR3C1+ PPARG+")

The document does not specify the exact tissue type, so "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field. The species is identified as Human based on the context of the study.
