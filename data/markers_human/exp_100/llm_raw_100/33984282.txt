14. ("null", "null", "conjunctival cells", "Krt17")
15. ("null", "null", "conjunctival cells", "Krt6")
16. ("null", "null", "conjunctival cells", "Krt8")

The species and tissue type were not explicitly mentioned in the text for these markers, so they are listed as "null" according to the instructions.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("null", "Cornea", "Outer limbal stem cells (qLSCs)", "Gpha2")
2. ("null", "Cornea", "Outer limbal stem cells (qLSCs)", "Ifitm3")
3. ("null", "Cornea", "Outer limbal stem cells (qLSCs)", "Cd63")
4. ("null", "Cornea", "Epithelial cells", "Krt17")

The species is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it is filled with "null". The tissue type and cell names are derived from the context of the document, and the markers are directly associated with the respective cell types as per the description.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "null", "LSCs (Limbal Stem Cells)", "IFITM3")
2. ("Human", "null", "LSCs (Limbal Stem Cells)", "GPHA2")
3. ("Human", "null", "Basal limbal epithelial cells", "KRT15")
4. ("Human", "null", "T cells", "Cd45")
5. ("Human", "null", "T cells", "Cd3")
6. ("Human", "null", "Regulatory T cells", "Cd4")
7. ("Human", "null", "Regulatory T cells", "Cd25")
8. ("Human", "null", "Regulatory T cells", "Foxp3")
9. ("Human", "null", "T cells", "Cd8")

Note: The species is specified as "Human" for all markers since the context of the document indicates that these markers are being discussed in the context of human cells. For tissue type, "null" is used because the specific tissue type is not always clearly defined or is broadly referred to (e.g., limbus).

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Mouse", "null", "LSC (Limbal Stem Cell)", "Gpha2")
2. ("Mouse", "null", "LSC (Limbal Stem Cell)", "Cd63")
3. ("Mouse", "null", "LSC (Limbal Stem Cell)", "Ifitm3")
4. ("Mouse", "null", "B cell", "Cd19")

The document does not specify a particular tissue type for these markers, so "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field.

19. ("Mouse", "Cornea", "B cells", "Cd79b")
20. ("Mouse", "Cornea", "null", "Gpha2")  # Gpha2 is mentioned in the context of marking the outer limbus but not directly associated with a specific cell type.
21. ("Mouse", "Cornea", "null", "Cd63")  # Cd63 is mentioned in the context of marking the outer limbus but not directly associated with a specific cell type.

Note: The last two entries (20 and 21) have "null" for the "Cell Name" field since the document does not specify a particular cell type for these markers, but they are used to mark the outer limbus.
