Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Activated cardiac fibroblasts", "CKAP4")
2. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Tissue-resident macrophages", "TIMD4")
3. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Tissue-resident macrophages", "LYVE1")
4. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Tissue-resident macrophages", "MHC-IIlo")
5. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Tissue-resident macrophages", "CCR2-")

These tuples are based on the information available in the document and follow the specified format. If any other field is missing or not specified, it has been filled with "null" as per the instructions. In this case, all fields were directly provided or could be inferred from the context.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("null", "null", "Endothelial cell", "ICAM-1")
2. ("null", "null", "Endothelial cell", "VCAM-1")
3. ("null", "null", "Endothelial cell", "MHC II")
4. ("null", "null", "Endothelial cell", "CD31")

The document does not specify the species or tissue type for these markers, hence those fields are filled with "null".
