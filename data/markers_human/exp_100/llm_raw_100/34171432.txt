Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. MDK (Midkine) is mentioned in the context of promoting immunosuppressive macrophage differentiation. However, it is not explicitly stated as a marker for a specific cell type but rather as a factor that interacts with its receptor LRP1 to influence macrophages. Since we need to follow the strict format and MDK is not directly defined as a marker for a particular cell, this information cannot be used to form a tuple.

2. CXCL10 is secreted by macrophages and interacts with its receptor CXCR3 on Tregs. This interaction suggests that CXCL10 could be a marker for macrophages, and CXCR3 for Tregs, in the context of gallbladder cancer with ErbB pathway mutations.

From the above, the tuples that can be formed are:

- ("Human", "Gallbladder cancer", "Macrophage", "CXCL10")
- ("Human", "Gallbladder cancer", "Treg", "CXCR3")

Therefore, the final answer is:

[("Human", "Gallbladder cancer", "Macrophage", "CXCL10"), ("Human", "Gallbladder cancer", "Treg", "CXCR3")]
