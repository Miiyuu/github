Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Lung", "Lyve1loMHCIIhi hIMs", "CXCR4")
2. ("Human", "Lung", "Lyve1loMHCIIhi hIMs", "CLEC10A")

12. ("Human", "Lung", "Lyve1+ cells", "CX3CR1")

These tuples are based on the specific mentions of cell types and their associated markers in the document.

Based on the provided text, there is no explicit mention of specific marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers that are used to distinguish different cell types. The document discusses different populations of macrophages (Lyve1loMHCIIhi and Lyve1hiMHCIIlo) and their characteristics, but it does not provide specific markers in the format required.

Therefore, the response is:

none

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Brown adipose tissue", "Sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages", "CX3CR1")
2. ("Human", "null", "Macrophages", "Lyve1")
3. ("Mouse", "null", "Macrophages", "Lyve1")
4. ("Mouse", "Arterial", "Macrophages", "Lyve1")

The text does not specify a particular tissue type for the human and mouse Lyve1+ macrophages, so "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" in those cases. Additionally, the arterial macrophages are described as being associated with blood vessels, but since no specific tissue other than "arterial" is mentioned, "Arterial" is used for the "Tissue Type" in that case.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified and formatted as requested:

1. ("Mouse", "Lung", "Macrophage (blood vessel associated)", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo")
2. ("Mouse", "Skin", "Macrophage (blood vessel associated)", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo")
3. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Macrophage (blood vessel associated)", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo")
4. ("Mouse", "Lung", "Macrophage (nerve associated)", "Lyve1loMHCIIhi")
5. ("Mouse", "Skin", "Macrophage (nerve associated)", "Lyve1loMHCIIhi")
6. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Macrophage (nerve associated)", "Lyve1loMHCIIhi")
7. ("Mouse", "Lung", "Macrophage", "CD68")
8. ("Mouse", "Skin", "Macrophage", "CD68")
9. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Macrophage", "CD68")
10. ("Mouse", "Lung", "Blood vessel", "CD31")
11. ("Mouse", "Skin", "Blood vessel", "CD31")
12. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Blood vessel", "CD31")
13. ("Mouse", "Lung", "Nerve", "TUBB3")
14. ("Mouse", "Skin", "Nerve", "TUBB3")
15. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Nerve", "TUBB3")
16. ("Mouse", "null", "Macrophage (nerve associated)", "CX3CR1")

Each tuple represents a specific marker for a particular cell type within a tissue from the species mentioned. The document does not specify all tissue types for some markers, hence "null" is used in those cases.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

- ("Mouse", "Lung", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo IMs", "Lyve1")

- ("Mouse", "Heart", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo IMs", "Lyve1")
- ("Mouse", "Fat", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo IMs", "Lyve1")

These tuples are based on the differential expression of Lyve1 and MHCII in different populations of immune cells (IMs) across various tissues. The species is consistently "Mouse" as per the context, and the tissue types and cell names are directly mentioned or inferred from the experimental conditions described.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Lung", "IM (Interstitial Macrophage)", "Lyve1hiMHCIIlo")
2. ("Mouse", "Lung", "IM (Interstitial Macrophage)", "Lyve1loMHCIIhi")

These markers are used to distinguish between two subpopulations of interstitial macrophages in the lung tissue of mice.

These tuples are based on the information that the document provides about different cell types and their associated markers in the context of the mouse lung tissue.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "null", "MRTMs (Macrophage-Related Tissue Macrophages)", "Lyve1")
2. ("Mouse", "null", "MRTMs (Macrophage-Related Tissue Macrophages)", "MHCII")

These markers are used to distinguish between two subpopulations of MRTMs: Lyve1hiMHCIIlo and Lyve1loMHCIIhi. The document does not specify a single tissue type for these markers but mentions that they are found across various tissues including fat, heart, bladder, mammary gland, muscle, pancreas, uterus, skin, brown adipose tissue, diaphragm, ganglia, trachea, tongue, testis, and meninges. Since no specific tissue is consistently associated with these markers in the context provided, "null" is used for the "Tissue Type" field.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Lung", "MRTMs (Macrophage-like cells)", "Lyve1")

4. ("Mouse", "null", "Monocyte-derived macrophages", "CX3CR1")
5. ("Mouse", "Adipose tissue", "Macrophage", "LYVE-1")

The information has been extracted from the methods and results sections where specific markers were used to identify different cell types in various tissues.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "null", "Classical dendritic cells and their committed progenitors", "Zbtb46")
2. ("Human and Mouse", "Mucosal tissue", "CD11b+ dendritic cells", "IRF4")
3. ("Human", "null", "CD141hi cross-presenting dendritic cells", "CD141")
4. ("Mouse", "null", "Nonlymphoid dendritic cells", "CD103")
5. ("Mouse", "Lymphatic endothelial cells", "Lymphatic endothelial cells", "Sphingosine kinase")
6. ("null", "Yolk sac", "Definitive hemogenic endothelium", "LYVE1")
7. ("Mouse", "null", "Tissue macrophages", "Multiple genes (profiles and pathways)")
8. ("null", "Arterial", "Macrophages", "LYVE-1")

Please note that for some entries, the "Species" or "Tissue Type" fields were not explicitly stated in the text, so "null" was used as a placeholder. Additionally, in the case of mouse tissue macrophages, specific marker genes were not listed, only that gene-expression profiles and transcriptional regulatory pathways underlie their identity, hence "Multiple genes (profiles and pathways)" is indicated.

Based on the provided document, I have identified the following cell markers. However, the document does not provide complete information for all fields in some cases. I will fill in "null" where specific information is missing.

1. ("Mouse", "null", "Endothelial cell", "Cdh5") - This marker is mentioned in the context of a novel endothelial-specific membrane protein, which is referenced but not explicitly named as Cdh5 in the given text. The reference to M. G. Lampugnani et al., 1992, suggests it, but the direct association with Cdh5 is inferred.
   
2. ("null", "null", "Lymphatic endothelial cells", "Ephrin-B2") - Ephrin-B2 is noted as controlling VEGF-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, indicating its role as a marker for lymphatic endothelial cells (Wang et al., 2010).

3. ("null", "null", "Dendritic cells (cDC1 and cDC2)", "null") - This entry is incomplete because while the document mentions the identification of cDC1- and cDC2-committed DC progenitors, it does not specify a particular marker gene or protein (Schlitzer et al., 2015).

4. ("null", "null", "Regulatory T cells (Tregs)", "Foxp3") - The document refers to the induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, suggesting Foxp3 as a marker for these cells (Onodera et al., 2015).

Since the third tuple has an empty "Marker" field, it should be excluded according to the instructions. Therefore, the final list of tuples is:

- ("Mouse", "null", "Endothelial cell", "Cdh5")
- ("null", "null", "Lymphatic endothelial cells", "Ephrin-B2")
- ("null", "null", "Regulatory T cells (Tregs)", "Foxp3")

If the document did not contain any clear marker information, the response would be "none". In this case, there are valid entries, so we do not return "none".

none
