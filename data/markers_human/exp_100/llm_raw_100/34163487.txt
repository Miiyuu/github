Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Colonic tissue", "CD8+ T cells (terminally differentiated, dysfunctional)", "IL-26")
2. ("null", "Skin", "Tissue-resident memory T cells", "RUNX3")
3. ("null", "Skin", "Tissue-resident memory T cells", "LGALS3")

The document does not provide explicit species information for the skin tissue-resident memory T cells, hence "null" is used for the "Species" field in those cases.
