9. ("Human", "null", "cDC2-TIMP1", "VEGFA")

These tuples are based on the information extracted from the document, where specific markers were associated with particular cell types. The tissue type is not explicitly mentioned for these cells in the text, hence it's marked as "null".

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "null", "DC3s", "CD1C")
2. ("Human", "null", "DC3s", "CD163")
3. ("Human", "null", "DC3s", "CD14")

The species is specified as "Human" because the context of the document discusses human cancers (HCC, CRC, CRLM). The tissue type is not explicitly mentioned for these markers, so it is filled with "null". The cell name is "DC3s", and the markers are "CD1C", "CD163", and "CD14".

Based on the information provided in the document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Human", "Tumor microenvironment", "TAMs (C1QC+)", "C1QC")
2. ("Human", "Tumor microenvironment", "TAMs (SPP1+)", "SPP1")
3. ("Human", "Tumor microenvironment", "cDC2s (C1QC+)", "C1QC")

8. ("Human", "null", "Macrophages", "CD68")
9. ("Human", "null", "Cells expressing Osteopontin", "Osteopontin")
10. ("Human", "null", "Cells expressing MARCO", "MARCO")

These tuples represent the species, tissue type, cell name, and specific marker as described in the text. The tissue type is set to "null" when it is not explicitly mentioned for a given cell marker.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. For SPP1+ TAMs (Tumor-Associated Macrophages), the document mentions the use of "mouse anti-human CD68" and "rabbit anti-human MARCO" as primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC) validation. This indicates that these proteins are used as markers to identify this specific type of cell. Since the species is human and the tissue type is not explicitly mentioned beyond being from tumor samples, we will denote the tissue as "Tumor". The cells are specifically referred to as "SPP1+ TAMs".

2. For DC3s (a subtype of dendritic cells), the primary antibodies listed are "mouse anti-human CD1C", "rabbit anti-human CD14", and "rabbit anti-human CD163". These proteins serve as markers for identifying DC3s. Similarly, the species is human, and the tissue is denoted as "Tumor" due to the context of the sample.

Thus, the tuples based on the information extracted are:

- ("Human", "Tumor", "SPP1+ TAM", "CD68")
- ("Human", "Tumor", "SPP1+ TAM", "MARCO")
- ("Human", "Tumor", "DC3", "CD1C")
- ("Human", "Tumor", "DC3", "CD14")
- ("Human", "Tumor", "DC3", "CD163")

These tuples represent the identification of different cell types within human tumor tissues using specific protein markers.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. For SPP1+ TAMs (Tumor-Associated Macrophages):
   - CD45
   - CD3
   - CD19
   - CD56
   - CD68
   - OPN (Osteopontin, also known as SPP1)

2. For DC3s (a subset of Dendritic Cells):
   - CD45
   - CD3
   - CD19
   - CD56
   - CD1C
   - CD14
   - CD163

3. Other markers mentioned for different immune cell types:
   - CD3D, CD3E (for T cells)
   - NKG7 (for NK cells)
   - CD79A, CD19 (for B cells)
   - CST3, CD68, LYZ, CAP3 (for myeloid cells)

Given the context, the species and tissue type are not explicitly stated, but since it involves human immune cells, we will assume "Human" as the species. The tissue type is not specified, so we will use "null" for that field.

Here are the tuples with the required format:

    ("Human", "null", "SPP1+ TAMs", "CD45"),
