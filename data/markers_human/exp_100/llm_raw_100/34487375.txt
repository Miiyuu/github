These tuples capture the species, tissue type, cell name, and specific marker genes as described in the text.

Based on the provided document, several neuropeptides and their receptors are discussed as markers for different cell populations. However, the document does not specify the exact species, tissue type, or cell names. Given the context, it is likely that the discussion is about mouse SCN (Suprachiasmatic Nucleus) cells. Here are the markers identified, with "null" filled in for missing information:

1. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Prok2")
2. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "ProkR2")
3. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Vip")
4. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Vipr2")
5. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Avp")
6. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Avpr1a")
7. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Grp")
8. ("Mouse", "SCN", "null", "Grpr")

These tuples represent the neuropeptide and receptor markers discussed in the text, with the assumption that the species is "Mouse" and the tissue type is "SCN" (Suprachiasmatic Nucleus). The specific cell names are not provided, so "null" is used in those fields.
