3. ("Mouse", "Esophagus", "Squamous cell", "p63")

The other mentions in the text, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and SmoM2, are related to signaling pathways or their components but do not serve as specific cell markers for the cell types discussed. Therefore, they are not included in the list.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("null", "Esophagus", "Esophageal cells", "Krt8")
2. ("null", "Esophagus", "Esophageal cells", "Sox9")
3. ("null", "Esophagus", "Esophageal cells", "CyclinD1")

These markers are associated with columnar differentiation in esophageal cells. The species is not explicitly mentioned, so it is filled as "null".

5. ("Human", "Barrett's esophagus", "Epithelial cells", "Agr2")
6. ("Human", "Barrett's esophagus", "Epithelial cells", "Muc2")

The document does not specify a direct marker for "EpHI cells" or "esophageal progenitors," and it mentions Cdx2 as a regulator but not necessarily a specific marker for any of the cell types in the context given. Therefore, Cdx2 is not included in the list.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers are identified. The information is organized according to the specified format:

1. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Columnar metaplasia cells", "EpCam")
2. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Columnar metaplasia cells", "Krt8")
3. ("Human", "Esophagus", "Columnar metaplasia cells", "Sox9")

These markers (EpCam, Krt8, and Sox9) are specifically mentioned as being expressed in human columnar metaplasia of the esophagus. The other details, such as the species and tissue type, are derived from the context provided in the text.

Based on the provided document, there is no explicit information about cell markers used to distinguish different cell types in a specific context of species, tissue type, and cell name. The document lists various antibodies and probes that are used for staining and analysis, but it does not specify their use as markers for particular cell types. Therefore, according to the requirements, the answer is:

none

none

none

none
