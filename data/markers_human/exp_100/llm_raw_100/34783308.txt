none

Based on the provided text, there is no explicit mention of specific cell markers for particular cell types in the mouse iris. The document discusses the use of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to define major cell types and mentions the validation of molecular markers, but it does not list any specific markers.

Therefore, the correct response is:

none

none

none

none

The provided document does not contain specific information about cell markers that are differentially expressed in distinct cell types. The text mainly lists antibodies and reagents used in the study, but it does not provide the necessary context to identify them as markers for specific cell types. Therefore, no tuples can be generated based on the given requirements.
