Based on the provided document, the following cell markers are identified for distinguishing different subsets of CD4 T cells in human ovarian cancer (OC):

- ("Human", "Ovarian cancer", "CD4 Tconv TILs", "PD-1")
- ("Human", "Ovarian cancer", "CD4 Tconv TILs", "CD39")

These markers are used to define different phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the CD4 T conventional (Tconv) subset. Specifically, PD-1 and CD39 expression levels help to categorize these cells into different functional states, including exhausted and non-exhausted phenotypes.
