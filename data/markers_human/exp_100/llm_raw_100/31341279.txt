Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified and formatted as requested. The document mentions specific genes that are expressed in particular cardiac cell types or regions, which can serve as markers for those cells.

1. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Right ventricle (RV) cells", "Pln") - Phospholamban (Pln) is predominantly expressed in RV cells.
2. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Right ventricle (RV) cells", "Cck") - Cholecystokinin (Cck) is also predominantly expressed in RV cells.
3. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Left-right asymmetric cells of the AHF and pSHF", "Nodal") - Nodal is co-expressed with other left-sided genes in these cells.
4. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Left-right asymmetric cells of the AHF and pSHF", "Lefty2") - Lefty2 is another gene co-expressed in these cells.
5. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Left-right asymmetric cells of the AHF and pSHF", "Pitx2") - Pitx2 is a third gene co-expressed in these cells.
6. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Population D (FHF, LV, and sarcomeric enriched)", "Isl1") - Isl1 is mentioned with minimal expression, suggesting it may help in distinguishing this population from others.

These tuples reflect the markers and their associated cell types as described in the document. If there's any additional information or further refinement needed, please let me know!

none

Based on the provided document, there is no specific mention of cell markers in the format required. The text discusses methods and criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes and cell fate determinators but does not list any particular marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers that are used to distinguish different cell types. Therefore, the response is:

none

These tuples are based on the information available in the document, and each marker is associated with a specific cell type or region within the myocardium or heart of mouse embryos.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified. The information is organized into tuples as requested:

1. ("null", "null", "Endodermal population", "Fgf8")

The species and tissue type are not explicitly mentioned in the text, so they are filled with "null" as per the instructions.

Based on the provided document, the following cell markers have been identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Right Ventricle (RV) cells", "Irx4")
2. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Right Ventricle (RV) cells", "Cck")
3. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Left Ventricle (LV) and Outflow Tract (OFT) cells", "Hand1")
4. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Left Ventricle (LV) and Outflow Tract (OFT) cells", "Hand2")

These markers are used to distinguish between different cardiac populations in mouse embryos at various developmental stages.

none

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

- Cck is a marker for right ventricle (RV) cells.
- Irx4 is also indicated as a marker for right ventricle (RV) cells.
- Sema3c is noted as a marker for anterior heart field (AHF) cells and their derivatives.

The species in the document is not explicitly stated, but given the context and the use of embryonic stages (E8.5), it is likely referring to a mouse model, which is common in developmental biology studies. The tissue type is cardiac, specifically focusing on different parts of the developing heart. Since the species is not directly mentioned, we will assume "Mouse" based on the typical experimental models used for such studies.

Thus, the information can be summarized into the following tuples:

1. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Right ventricle cells", "Cck")
2. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Right ventricle cells", "Irx4")
3. ("Mouse", "Heart", "Anterior heart field cells", "Sema3c")

These tuples meet the requirements as they are derived from the provided text, and each includes a specific marker.
