These markers are inferred from the genes that display changes in expression or binding in the context of Atoh7 mutants, specifically within retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neurogenic retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). The species is not explicitly mentioned, but given the context of the research, it can be assumed to be a model organism like mouse, though this is not directly stated. Therefore, "Species" and "Tissue Type" are filled with "null" as per the instructions.

Based on the provided text, the following cell markers can be identified:

1. ("Mouse", "Retina", "RGCs", "Atoh7-bound and down-regulated in Atoh7 mutants")
2. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Neurogenic cells or photoreceptor precursors", "Neurod1")
3. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Neurogenic cells or photoreceptor precursors", "Neurog2")

Based on the provided document, there is no explicit mention of cell markers in the context of distinguishing different cell types. The document primarily discusses transgenic mouse lines and antibodies used for immunohistochemistry. Since the information about specific cell markers (marker genes, signature genes, protein markers, or molecular markers) that are used to distinguish different cell types is not provided, the appropriate response is:

none

Based on the provided text, there are no explicit mentions of cell markers in the format required, such as marker genes, signature genes, or protein markers that are specifically used to distinguish different cell types. The document primarily describes the use of various antibodies for immunostaining and the methodology for imaging and quantifying retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in both adult and embryonic retinas.

However, some of the antibodies mentioned can be considered as markers for specific cell types in the context of the retina:

- **Opn4**: This is a marker for intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).
- **Pax6**: This is a transcription factor involved in eye development and can be a marker for certain retinal progenitor cells.
- **Rxrgamma (RxrÎ³)**: This is a nuclear receptor and may be used as a marker for specific retinal cell types, though it is not explicitly stated in the text.
- **Cone arrestin**: This is a marker for cone photoreceptors.
- **Calbindin**: This is often used as a marker for certain subtypes of RGCs and other retinal neurons.
- **Brn3a**: This is a transcription factor and a well-known marker for RGCs.

Given the requirements, we can construct the following tuples based on the information available:

1. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell", "Opn4")
2. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Retinal progenitor cell", "Pax6")
3. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Cone photoreceptor", "Cone arrestin")
4. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Retinal ganglion cell", "Calbindin")
5. ("Mouse", "Retina", "Retinal ganglion cell", "Brn3a")

The species is assumed to be "Mouse" based on the context of the study. The tissue type is "Retina" as the document discusses retinal cells. The cell names are inferred from the known roles of the markers in the retina. 

Since "Rxrgamma" is not explicitly linked to a specific cell type in the document, it is not included in the list.
